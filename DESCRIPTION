Title: Fused Matrix Library
Version: 0.1-1
Description: Interface to the 'fml' library, which defines a single
    "medium-level" interface for multiple dense matrix types (CPU, GPU, and
    MPI), each supporting multiple fundamental types (half, float, double). Data
    is held externally to R and operations that modify data generally occur
    in-place. The 'fmlr' interface largely tracks with the core 'fml' interface.
    We use R6 so that generally an R code can be easily translated to C++.
