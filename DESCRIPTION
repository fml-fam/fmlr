Title: Fused Matrix Library for R
Version: 0.3-0
Description: 'fmlr' is an R interface to the 'fml' library. It is a
    "medium-level" interface for multiple dense matrix types, principally CPU,
    GPU, and MPI. Each supports multiple fundamental types (int, float, double),
    and data is held externally to R and operations that modify data generally
    occur in-place. The interface largely tracks with the core 'fml' interface.
    The interface is written such that generally an 'fmlr' R code can be easily
    translated to an 'fml' C++ code.
